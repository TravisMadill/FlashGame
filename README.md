# FlashGame

This is a Flash game I made as one of the final projects in my Grade 12 programming class. And it was all made with Flash CS5.5.

Because this was an actual project for me, this repository contains some stuff I wouldn't normally include in my usual mini-projects, like flowcharts and detailed comments and an actual readme file.

Since this was exported by Flash, it exports stuff like this as a webpage, so you can check out the game for yourself here: https://travismadill.github.io/FlashGame/FinalFlashGame.html

## Original readme to my programming teacher
This game is basically a point-and-click game where you click on targets that
appear randomly in random locations, but there’s a catch! Hands will start
appearing and try to take your gun away. They’ll steal your gun if you move your
mouse over the hand. You have to try and get your gun back by clicking on the
hand and get it back.

By the way, yes I am aware that some things about the hand aren’t 100%
functional, but that’s mainly because of major time constraints from this and other
classes and my newness (is that a word?) to Flash and all its ins and outs. What I
mean is that there would be times when I would not realise that I didn’t put in the
“addChild” command to the stage, and get hung up on it for longer than I should
have.

By the way, the credit for the backdrops goes to Daniel Horia who is an artist who
runs a blog. The fireworks photo credits go to ColourBox. The music used is from
(**edit**: This originally contained copyrighted music, so before posting this, I replaced
this with the wind sound from my XNAGame. Y'know, for moodiness). That’s the only
name I could find. It sounded like a good fit. Also thanks to SoundJay for their
sound effects. And all the drawings are still drawn by me.
